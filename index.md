CPSC 120

In Lab 3 I enjoyed it because it provided a hands-on opportunity to reinforce fundamental programming skills, such as using variables, arithmetic operators, and functions. Writing code that interacts with input and output was engaging, as it helped bridge theoretical concepts with practical application. Additionally, performing black-box testing to ensure the code was bug-free added a layer of problem-solving and critical thinking, which was both challenging and rewarding.

In Lab 5 I enjoyed it because it allowed me to deepen my understanding of conditional logic through writing if statements to implement domain-specific functionality. Working with multiple files helped me experience a modular approach to coding, which enhanced my organizational and project management skills. The task of converting between integers and doubles provided practical insight into handling data types effectively. Additionally, using unit tests and system tests to guide development was both challenging and rewarding, as it encouraged a structured and test-driven approach to writing reliable, high-quality code.

In Lab 8 I enjoyed it because it provided valuable experience in validating command-line arguments, which is a practical skill for real-world programming. Writing a loop to iterate through command-line inputs, excluding the command name, was a great exercise in logic and efficiency. Using loops to process values and nested loops to print patterns was both challenging and fun, as it allowed me to see how small, structured pieces of code can create complex and interesting outputs. The assignment was engaging and enhanced my problem-solving and coding skills.
